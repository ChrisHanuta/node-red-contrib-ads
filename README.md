# node-red-contrib-ads

Beckhoff TwinCat ADS support for Node-Red. Provides nodes to talk to TwinCat PLC variables over ADS.

Uses the NODE-ADS library for Node.JS (https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-ads).

It's tested with TwinCat 2 but its also works with TwinCat 3. Look at the Port.

For the latest updates see the [CHANGELOG.md](https://github.com/ChrisHanuta/node-red-contrib-ads/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md)

## Installation

```sh
cd ~/.node-red
npm install node-red-contrib-ads
```

## Requirements
* Beckhoff PLC that has an ethernet connection and is connected to your LAN
    * Make your you give the PLC a fixed IP address
    * Make sure you can ping the PLC from another computer

## Configuration

1. Enable ADS on your PLC project. To do this click on your task and then enable the checkbox before `Create symbols` (if he is not disabled).
In addition, you can still, under I/O Devices click on Image and go to the ADS tab. Check the `Enable ADS Server` and also `Create symbols`.
Download the new configuration and make sure you reboot your PLC. The reboot is only needed when you are using TwinCat 2.

2. Now add a static route to our Beckhoff PLC. The route should point to your server that will run the proxy application.
It's also a good idea to add an extra static route that points to your local development device. This way you can test out the proxy from your development device too.

### Attention

1. TwinCAT AMS Router doesn't allow multiple TCP connections from the same host. So when you use two AdsLib instances on the same host to connect to the same TwinCAT router, you will see that TwinCAT will close the first TCP connection and only respond to the newest. If you start the TwinCat System Manager and Node-Red ADS on the same PC at the same time, Node-Red will not run anymore. You can set up a second IPv4 on the PC and assign to this a ADS NET ID under Twincat

2. As ADS is transmitted over a TCP connection, there is no real time guarantee.


## Global variables
Global variables must start with a dot: ```.engine```
```
VAR_GLOBAL
	engine		AT %QX0.0:	BOOL;
	deviceUp	AT %QX0.1:	BOOL;
	deviceDown	AT %QX0.2:	BOOL;
	timerUp:					TON;
	timerDown:				TON;
	steps:					BYTE;
	count:					UINT := 0;
	devSpeed:				TIME := t#10ms;
	devTimer:				TON;
	switch: BOOL;
END_VAR
```

Program variables must start with the programname: ```MAIN.UpTyp.timerUp.PT```



## Nodes added by this package

#### - ads-connection

A node that represents a TwinCat ADS device.
Be sure to create one for an PLC.

```
Host: IP address of the PLC
Target NetId: ADS NET ID of the PLC in the format 192.168.2.5.1.1
Source NetId: ADS NET ID for node red in the format 192.168.2.10.1.1 the same as the one added to the static route in the Beckhoff PLC.
Port: Normally 48898 for TwinCat 2/3
Source Port: Normally 801 for TwinCat 2 Runtime 1 or 851 for TwinCat 3 Runtime 1
Target Port: Normally 32905 for TwinCat 2/3
```

#### - ADS System

Twincat ADS node that give you information about the PLC and PLC state.

##### input
You can write anything on the input, then the system state is pushed to the output.

##### output
```
msg.payload : Object
{ "connectState":2,
  "connectStateText":"CONNECTED",
  "adsState":5,
  "adsStateText":"RUN",
  "majorVersion":2,
  "minorVersion":11,
  "versionBuild":2605,
  "version":"2.11.2605",
  "deviceName":"TCatPlcCtrl",
  "symTab":138
}
```
###### Connect state (text)
The following connect state values are possible:
```
ERROR:                     -1
DISCONNECTED:               0
CONNECTIG:                  1
CONNECTED:                  2
DISCONNECTING:              3
```

###### ADS state (text)
The following ADS state values are possible:
```
INVALID:      0
IDLE:         1
RESET:        2
INIT:         3
START:        4
RUN:          5
STOP:         6
SAVECFG:      7
LOADCFG:      8
POWERFAILURE: 9
POWERGOOD:    10
ERROR:        11
SHUTDOWN:     12
SUSPEND:      13
RESUME:       14
CONFIG:       15
RECONFIG:     16
STOPPING:     17
```

###### Version
This is the version of the PLC runtime. Either in single parts ("majorVersion", "minorVersion", "versionBuild") or assembled ("version")

###### Devicename
The Name of the PLC-Device

###### symTab
The PLC internal version number of the variable HÃ¤ndel assignment


#### - ADS Out

Twincat ADS output node that can send values to the PLC.

Enter the name of the variable, the type and the property name. If ads is connected the value is written to the PLC


#### - ADS In

Twincat ADS input node that can recive values from the PLC.

Enter the name of the variable, the type and the property name for the output. 
You can still decide whether a new output with the property for the value will be created or the property will be inserted into the inputvalue and output at the output.


#### - ADS Notification

Twincat ADS input node that can automatically recive values from the PLC, if they change.
Beckhoff says you should not have more than 510 variables monitored.
Each time the ADS-Node is connected to the PLC, the PLC automatically sends the value once.

Transmission Mode: With "cyclic", the variable is polled cyclically by the PLC and transmitted, with "onchange" the PLC monitors.
Max Delay:  At the latest after this time, the ADS Device Notification is called. The unit is 1ms.
Cycle Time:  The ADS server checks if the value changes in this time slice. The unit is 1ms


#### - ADS Symbols

This note loads a list of all symbols or types from the PLC when written to the input. If a string or string array is written, the output is filtered by name. Wildcards [?=char;*=chars] are possible.

This example makes an file for excel.
